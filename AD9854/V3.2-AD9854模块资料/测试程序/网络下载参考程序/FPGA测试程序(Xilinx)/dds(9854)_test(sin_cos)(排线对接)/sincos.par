INFO:Par:340 - 
   The Delay report will not be generated when running non-timing driven PAR
   with effort level Standard or Medium. If a delay report is required please do
   one of the following:  1) use effort level High, 2) use the following
   environment variable "XIL_PAR_GENERATE_DLY_REPORT", 3) create Timing
   constraints for the design.
